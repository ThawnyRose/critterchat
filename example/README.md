Example files for deploying a production version of this software manually. The `critterchat-nginx-conf` file should be customized to your installation and then placed into `/etc/nginx/sites-available` and then symlinked into `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled` to enable it. The `critterchat.service` file should be customized to your installation and then placed into `/etc/systemd/system`. The `baremetal.config.yaml` file should be customized to your installation and placed alongside the deploy directory you've chosen. Then, run `systemctl daemon-reload` to load the file, `systemctl enable critterchat` to enable the service on boot and finally `systemctl start critterchat` to start the service. If all goes to plan, systemd will manage the python backend and nginx should provide SSL termination, attachment and static handling and proxy requests to the python backend.
